An emergency utility app for Metro Manila

This is a personal project I made with my friend for his final project on his Masters degree. Eventually, we tried to make it as fully functional. This app helps anyone whose in a emergency situation within the 17 cities in NCR, Philippines. It allows you to call a police station, hospital, and fire department in the current city you are in. It automatically detects your location and gives you the correct phone numbers to call. It also provides the phone numbers for other important government agencies in the Philippines. We released this app in both iOS and Android.
