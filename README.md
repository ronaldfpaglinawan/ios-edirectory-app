An emergency utility app for Metro Manila

This is a personal project I made with my friend for his final project on his Masters degree. Eventually we tried to make it as fully functional. This app helps anyone whose in emergency situation within the 17 cities in NCR in Philippines. It allows you to call a police station, hospital, fire department in the current city you are in. It automatically detects your location and gives you the correct phone numbers. It also provides the phone numbers for other important government agencies in the Philippines.
